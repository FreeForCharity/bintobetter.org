### Repository History

This repository was created using the Free For Charity website template and converted to serve the BinToBetter nonprofit organization. The template provided a professional, accessible, and performant static HTML website structure that was adapted for BinToBetter's mission of waste reduction and environmental sustainability.

**BinToBetter** is a youth-led nonprofit organization that transforms used tennis balls, e-waste, and hard-to-recycle plastics into valuable tools for schools, seniors, and students through hands-on recycling initiatives and educational workshops.
