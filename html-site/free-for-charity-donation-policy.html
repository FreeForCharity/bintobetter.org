              Free For Charity accepts publicly traded securities and other forms of marketable
              securities. Donations of securities will be liquidated promptly upon receipt unless
              otherwise directed by the Board of Directors. This ensures that the value of the
              donation can be utilized effectively to support our mission. Donors are encouraged to

              Donations of real estate will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The organization
              will conduct a thorough evaluation, including environmental assessments, title
              searches, and market analyses, to determine the suitability and potential liabilities
              associated with the property. Real estate donations can provide significant support
              for our long-term sustainability and growth, but it is essential to ensure that the
              property aligns with our mission and does not pose undue financial or legal risks.

              Tangible personal property, such as art, antiques, and vehicles, may be accepted if
              deemed useful to the organization’s mission or if the property can be sold for
              financial gain. Donors are encouraged to provide a detailed description and valuation
              of the property to facilitate the acceptance process. Personal property donations can
              enhance our fundraising efforts and provide unique opportunities for donor engagement.

              needs of the organization and align with our mission. Donors are encouraged to contact
              us in advance to discuss the specifics of their in-kind donation. These contributions
